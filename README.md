Employee Salary Dashboard - Data Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project leverages the ds_salary dataset to create an interactive Tableau dashboard that provides insights into employee salaries across various employment types, experience levels, and company sizes. The dashboard is designed to help organizations and data analysts visualize key trends in employee compensation, segmented by employment type, experience, company size, and geographical location.

Key Features
Average Salary by Employment Type and Experience: Visualizations that present the average salary data across different employment types and experience levels.

Employment Type Pie Chart: A pie chart showing the distribution of employees across various employment types (e.g., Full-time, Part-time, Freelance, etc.).

Company Size Pie Chart: A pie chart representing the percentage of employees working in companies of different sizes (e.g., Small, Medium, Large).

Geographical Distribution: A map visualization utilizing OpenStreetMap to display employee locations based on the provided dataset, showing salary distribution across different regions.

Data Sources
The dashboard uses the ds_salary dataset, which includes various attributes related to employee salaries, including:

Salary: The annual salary of employees.

Experience: The years of experience employees have.

Employment Type: Full-time, Part-time, Freelance, etc.

Company Size: Size of the company (Small, Medium, Large).

Location: Geographical information of employees.

Dashboard Description
The dashboard is divided into multiple sections:

Salary Analysis by Employment Type and Experience: This section displays the average salary distribution, categorized by employment type and years of experience. Interactive filters allow users to explore the data for specific categories and refine their analysis.

Employee Type Pie Chart: A pie chart visualizes the proportion of different employment types within the dataset, offering a quick overview of the workforce composition.

Company Size Pie Chart: Another pie chart showcases the company size breakdown, providing insights into which company types pay the highest salaries.

Geographical Distribution: An interactive map powered by OpenStreetMap provides the geographical distribution of employee locations. The map allows users to click and hover over regions to see salary insights tied to specific locations.
